# Example-Code-Architecture

This contains code for Prosthesis v1 firmware as of 01/29/2025. The flow of code is main.c performs definitions and initializations, the main loop calls the device library (prosthesis_v1.c), and the device library calls the sensor/actuator drivers.

## Important Notes

 - The device library prosthesis_v1.c contains the RunStateMachine() function.
 - Sensor/actuator drivers are saved in the "Drivers" project directory.
 - A file search on "USER ADDED" will show all the locations where additional code was added to the autogenerated MX files.
